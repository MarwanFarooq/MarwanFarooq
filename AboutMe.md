👋 Hi, I’m @MarwanFarooq
👀 I’m interested in front-end development, React, Next.js, and creating interactive, user-friendly web applications.
🌱 I’m currently expanding my skills by learning backend development. I’m focusing on C# and ASP.NET, exploring areas like building REST APIs, handling server-side logic, database integration with Entity Framework, and ensuring application security and scalability. With C#, I’m learning to write efficient, clean, and maintainable code, while ASP.NET helps me grasp web development from a backend perspective, including routing, middleware, and API handling. Together with my front-end knowledge, I’m working towards becoming a full-stack developer.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exciting front-end or full-stack projects, especially in e-commerce or dashboard development, where I can contribute to both the user interface and backend architecture.

⚡ Fun fact: I built my first front-end project as a simulation of an e-commerce website with a fully functional admin dashboard!
